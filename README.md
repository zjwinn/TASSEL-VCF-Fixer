# TASSEL-VCF-Fixer
The Trait Analysis by aSSociation, Evolution and Linkage (TASSEL) 5.0 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) standalone pipeline version 2.0 produces a VCF which is always coded a major/minor allele. This program, written in Bash, is made to fix this and recode the alleles in reference/alternative.
